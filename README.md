GitKraken Mock Site Design
v.0.1.0

This will be a mock recreation of the GitKraken website for purposes of learning, using my own custom code, playing around with Bootstrap, the Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB) sub-framework, and some other play and familiarization with processes and technologies that I'm focused on learning.

Commit #1 - Initial Readme created.

I have decided to first focus on the creation of the GitKracken site for the specific GitKraken Client/App page.
For reference: https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client

Commit #2 - Initial Project Structure setup.
* Directories sorted.
* File locations (hrefs) properly directed.
* Bootstrap/MDB tested.
* FontAwesome tested.
* Basic CSS template setup, visual markers setup.
* JavaScript/jQuery tested.
* => Ready to move forward.
* First //push// to Github. <- Development Branch.

Commit #3 - Basic HTML site specific skeleton written (head/sections/footer)
* Added master color reference to style.css file.
* Modified Readme.md
